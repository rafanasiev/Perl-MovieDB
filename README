* DESCRIPTION 
    MovieDB - simple Perl-code for review

* TASK
    Implement a storage system for movies. The interface should be command line. Movie information must be 
stored persistently (i.e. shutting down the process and starting it back up should not cause any data loss).  
You are expected to use an object oriented design approach.

These are the properties of movie:
-   Identifier (system defined unique id)
-   Title
-   Release year
-   Format (one of VHS, DVD, or Blu-Ray)
-   Stars (list of names, each as one atomic string)

These are the features that must be supported:
-   Add movie (prompt for the properties)
-   Delete movie (prompt for the identifier)
-   Display movie (prompt for the identifier, show properties)
-   List movies by title (list title and identifier of all movies, alphabetically by title)
-   List movies by year (list title and identifier of all movies, chronologically by year)
-   Find movies by title (prompt for a search string, list title and identifier of any movie whose title contains that string)
-   Find movies by star (prompt for star name, list title and identifier of any movie including that star)
-   Import movies (from provided text file)
